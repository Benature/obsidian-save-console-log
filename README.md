When enabled, this plugin will save the log from the Obsidian developer console to a file. This is only useful for debugging plugins. It is mostly needed on mobile, where the developer console cannot be easily accessed as it can in the desktop versions.

The implementation was blatantly stolen from [this gist](https://gist.github.com/liamcain/3f21f1ee820cb30f18050d2f3ad85f3f) by [Liam Cain](https://github.com/liamcain).
